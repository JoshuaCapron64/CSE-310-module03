# Overview

This software is meant to be a basic tutorial and demonstration of Erlang's functions and uses, alongside some brief explanations of how and why Erlang works differently from other traditional languages such as Python or C#. I am writing this hoping to put into practice the things I learned in an Erlang class I took and finished shortly before writing this code, as well as generally expand upon that knowledge.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code along with the erlang extension created by Pierrick Gourlain in order to create this software.

I primarily used the Erlang language. Creating this software didn't require the use of any additional languages or libraries.

# Future Work

* Include more examples of recursive functions that utilize guards
* Include more examples of terminal commands that don't require compiled .beam file to function
* Maybe rewrite the software, or create a seperate version that focuses more on the terminal than on the contents of the .erl file.
